This is a fun little project using both Python and Pandas to explore a data set called *'jeopardy.csv'* This data set spans across 3 decades (1984-2012) and contains episode numbers, show dates, categories, questions, answers, and their associated values for the popular quiz show *Jeopardy.* I decided to explore this data set further because of its captivating intrigue. The data set is full of interesting things to discover and play around with!\n",
